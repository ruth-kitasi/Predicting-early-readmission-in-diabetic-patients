Diabetes, is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.It is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, affecting millions of individuals and placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. In the United States alone, diabetes management accounts for a substantial portion of healthcare expenditures, driven by complications, hospitalizations, and frequent readmissions. Despite advancements in medical care and evidence-based interventions, many diabetic patients continue to experience suboptimal outcomes due to inconsistent management and inadequate follow-up care.

Hospital readmissions, particularly those occurring within 30 days of discharge, are a critical concern in diabetes care. These early readmissions not only indicate gaps in patient management but also contribute to increased healthcare costs and poorer patient outcomes. For diabetic patients, unplanned readmissions are often linked to preventable factors such as poor glycemic control, medication non-adherence, and insufficient post-discharge support. Addressing these challenges is essential to improving patient care and reducing the financial strain on healthcare systems.
