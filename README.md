# Predicting-early-readmission-in-diabetic-patience
## Introduction
Diabetes, is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.It is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, affecting millions of individuals and placing a significant burden on healthcare systems. In the United States alone, diabetes management accounts for a substantial portion of healthcare expenditures, driven by complications, hospitalizations, and frequent readmissions. Despite advancements in medical care and evidence-based interventions, many diabetic patients continue to experience suboptimal outcomes due to inconsistent management and inadequate follow-up care.

Hospital readmissions, particularly those occurring within 30 days of discharge, are a critical concern in diabetes care. These early readmissions not only indicate gaps in patient management but also contribute to increased healthcare costs and poorer patient outcomes. For diabetic patients, unplanned readmissions are often linked to preventable factors such as poor glycemic control, medication non-adherence, and insufficient post-discharge support. Addressing these challenges is essential to improving patient care and reducing the financial strain on healthcare systems.

## Problem statement
Despite advancements in diabetes care, a significant challenge remains: early readmissions within 30 days of discharge for diabetic patients. These readmissions are costly, not only financially, but also in terms of patient outcomes, as they often signal inadequate care and suboptimal glycemic control during the initial hospital stay.

Many factors contribute to these early readmissions, including poor diabetes management, lack of proper follow-up care, and inconsistent patient adherence to treatment protocols. Unfortunately, healthcare providers currently lack reliable predictive tools to identify high-risk patients before discharge, which prevents them from taking timely, preventive action to reduce the likelihood of readmission.

This research aims to leverage clinical data from 130 U.S. hospitals spanning 1999 to 2008 to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at risk of early readmission. By focusing on patient demographics, lab results, medications, and clinical procedures, the goal is to improve patient outcomes, reduce readmission rates, and minimize the financial burden on healthcare systems.

#### Primary Objectives

1. Develop a Predictive Model for Early Readmissions:
Build a machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetic patients being readmitted to the hospital `within 30 days` of discharge.

2. Identify Key Risk Factors for Early Readmissions:
Analyze patient demographics, laboratory results, medications, and clinical procedures to determine the most significant factors contributing to early readmissions among diabetic patients.

#### Secondary Objectives

3. Evaluate Model Performance and Generalizability:
Assess the predictive model's accuracy, precision, recall, and generalizability to ensure it can be effectively applied across diverse hospital settings and patient populations.

4. Provide Actionable Insights for Healthcare Providers:
Translate the model's findings into practical recommendations for healthcare providers to improve diabetes management, reduce readmission rates, and enhance patient outcomes.

5. Optimize Resource Allocation:
Use the predictive model to help hospitals identify high-risk patients and allocate resources more efficiently, reducing unnecessary healthcare costs and improving the quality of care
